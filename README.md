# Mindful Video
Manually importing & organizing HD/UHD footage from modern mirrorless/DSLR cameras is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to the sheer volume of data that these new cameras & media formats produce. This is my attempt to create an automated, organized, & customizable process to help with this immense task of video organization.
